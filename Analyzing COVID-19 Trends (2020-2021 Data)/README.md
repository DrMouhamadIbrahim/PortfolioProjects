# Analyzing COVID-19 Trends (2020-2021 Data)

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 trends using data from 2020-2021. The goal is to extract insights on case trends, mortality rates, and other key factors during this period.

## Key Features
- Data analysis using SQL for extracting meaningful insights.
- Analysis focuses on trends like peak case periods, mortality rates, and geographic differences.

## Files in This Project
- **Analyzing COVID-19 Trends (2020-2021 Data).sql**: The SQL script used to analyze the data.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the SQL script in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Review the output for key insights.

## Insights and Results
- Extracted insights and trends from large datasets through data analysis and manipulation of 85k+ records, applying 10+ complex SQL queries utilizing Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, and Aggregate Functions.
- Devised mortality risk models using statistical analysis to correlate cases and deaths, identifying Lebanon's peak death rate of 4.92%.
- Evaluated mortality disparities by normalizing death rates per capita, identifying Hungary with the highest rate of 0.28%.
- Determined high-risk regions by analyzing infection rates per capita, exposing Andorra (17.12%) and Montenegro (15.5%) as the most impacted countries.
- Assessed vaccination progress by calculating dynamic vaccination rates, demonstrating that the U.S. had vaccinated over 68% of its population with at least one dose by the analysis end date.
