# 📊 Analyzing COVID-19 Trends (2020-2021 Data)

## 📝 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 trends using data from 2020-2021. The analysis focuses on extracting insights related to case trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress during the pandemic period.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Analysis Using SQL:** Conducted comprehensive data analysis using SQL to extract meaningful insights from the datasets.
- **Focus Areas:** Analyzed trends such as peak case periods, mortality rates, vaccination progress, and geographic disparities.

## 📂 Files in This Project
- [**SQL Script: Analyzing COVID-19 Trends (2020-2021 Data).sql**](Analyzing%20COVID-19%20Trends%20(2020-2021%20Data).sql): The SQL script used for data analysis and extraction of insights.
- **Datasets**:
  - [**COVID-19 Cases and Deaths (2020-2021).xlsx**](COVID-19%20Cases%20and%20Deaths%20(2020-2021).xlsx): Contains daily COVID-19 case and death statistics globally.
  - [**COVID-19 Vaccination Data (2020-2021).xlsx**](COVID-19%20Vaccination%20Data%20(2020-2021).xlsx): Details vaccination progress by country, including doses administered, fully vaccinated, and more.

## 📈 Insights and Results
- **Data Analysis and Manipulation**: Analyzed over 85k records using complex SQL queries, including Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, and Aggregate Functions.
- **Mortality Risk Models**: Developed models to correlate cases and deaths, revealing Lebanon's peak death rate of **4.92%**.
- **Mortality Disparities**: Normalized death rates per capita to identify Hungary as having the highest mortality rate of **0.28%**.
- **High-Risk Regions**: Determined high-risk regions based on infection rates per capita, with Andorra (**17.12%**) and Montenegro (**15.5%**) being the most impacted.
- **Vaccination Progress Assessment**: Calculated dynamic vaccination rates, showing that the U.S. vaccinated over **68%** of its population with at least one dose by the end date of analysis.
